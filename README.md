This project focuses on predicting Tesla’s stock closing price using Deep Learning models designed for time-series data.
I implement and compare SimpleRNN and LSTM models to forecast 1-day, 5-day, and 10-day future prices, and deploy the final solution using Streamlit.

Stock market data is sequential and time-dependent, where future prices depend on historical trends.
The objective of this project is to:

Build Deep Learning models (SimpleRNN & LSTM) for stock price prediction
Compare their performance
Predict short-term future prices (1, 5, 10 days)
Deploy the model as a web application
